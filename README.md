This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

**Features**

**Search by City**
Enter a city name in the search input field to filter users based on their city. The search is not case-sensitive.

**Sort Users**
Click the "Sort" button in the user table to sort users alphabetically by their names.

**Pagination**
Navigate through paginated results using the page number buttons. Five users are displayed per page.

**Additional Notes**
The application uses React's Context API to manage user data.
Initial user data is fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API. An active internet connection is necessary to load the initial user data.
The application is designed to be responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes.
